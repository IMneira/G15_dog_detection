CMake Error at /home/isaias/esp/idf/esp-idf/tools/cmake/build.cmake:552 (message):
  ERROR: Some components (espressif/esp-tflite-micro) in the
  "managed_components" directory were modified on the disk since the last run
  of the CMake.  Content of this directory is managed automatically.

  If you want to keep the changes, you can move the directory with the
  component to the "components"directory of your project.

  I.E.  for "espressif__esp-tflite-micro" run:

  mv /home/isaias/esp-tflite-micro/dog
  detection/managed_components/espressif__esp-tflite-micro
  /home/isaias/esp-tflite-micro/dog
  detection/components/espressif__esp-tflite-micro

  Or, if you want to discard the changes remove the ".component_hash" file
  from the component's directory.

  I.E.  for "espressif__esp-tflite-micro" run:

  rm /home/isaias/esp-tflite-micro/dog
  detection/managed_components/espressif__esp-tflite-micro/.component_hash
